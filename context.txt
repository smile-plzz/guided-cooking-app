# Project Context and History

This document summarizes the recent development history and current state of the Guided Cooking App.

## Key Changes and Fixes:

### Backend (`server/`)
- **Database Migration:** Migrated from `recipes.json` file storage to SQLite database using Sequelize ORM. This involved:
    - Adding `sequelize` and `sqlite3` as dependencies.
    - Creating `server/config/config.json` for database configuration.
    - Creating `server/database.js` to define the Sequelize models and database connection.
    - Updating `server/server.js` to use the `Recipe` model for CRUD operations instead of file I/O.
- **API Key Handling:** Added a warning if `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY` is missing in the `.env` file.
- **Improved Error Handling:** Standardized API error responses to return JSON objects with a `message` property.
- **Dependency Updates:** Updated `dotenv` and `express` to their latest versions.
- **Removed Redundancy:** Removed the unused `node-fetch` dependency.
- **Database Seeding:** Added logging to the database seeding process in `server/server.js` to confirm successful recipe insertion.
- **Data Consistency:** Standardized `id` types in `server/data/recipes.json` to strings to ensure consistency with React keys and prevent rendering issues.
- **Backend Testing:**
    - Enhanced `server/tests/recipes.test.js` to include comprehensive tests for CRUD operations with full recipe data (image, readyInMinutes, servings, extendedIngredients, analyzedInstructions).
    - Added tests for error handling (invalid data, non-existent recipes).
    - Added tests for the `/api/recipes/favorites` endpoint.
    - Refactored seeding logic in `server/server.js` into an exportable `seedDatabase` function for proper testing.
    - Fixed `Recipe` model in `server/database.js` to correctly handle `extendedIngredients` and `analyzedInstructions` as `DataTypes.JSON`.
    - Corrected `title` field in `Recipe` model to be `allowNull: false` and renamed `time` to `readyInMinutes` with `DataTypes.INTEGER`.
    - All backend tests are now passing.

### Frontend (`client/`)
- **Dependency Updates:** Updated various dependencies, including `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom`, and `@tanstack/react-query`.
- **React Router v6 API:** Updated routing in `client/src/App.js` to correctly use the `react-router-dom` v6 API.
- **QueryClientProvider:** Wrapped the application with `QueryClientProvider` in `client/src/index.js`.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Removed the custom `build:tailwind` script and `index.module.css`. Integrated Tailwind CSS directly by importing its directives in `client/src/index.css`.
- **Dependency Reinstallation:** Performed a forced reinstallation of `npm` dependencies to resolve `react-scripts` not found issues.
- **Syntax Fixes:** Corrected `SyntaxError` in `client/src/components/RecipeList.js` by removing an extra parenthesis.
- **Timer Component Fix:** Removed `Timer.module.css` import and usage from `client/src/components/Timer.js` and replaced with inline Tailwind classes.
- **Navbar Refactoring:** Refactored `client/src/components/Navbar.js` to remove search/filter inputs, moving them to `client/src/components/RecipeList.js` for better modularity.
- **Design Improvements (RecipeDetail.js):**
    - Enhanced overall container styling with comprehensive background, text, and spacing.
    - Improved header section with prominent title and organized action buttons.
    - Refined image display for visual appeal and responsiveness.
    - Structured content sections (Ingredients, Nutrition, Instructions) with clear headings, cards, and consistent spacing.
    - Modernized interactive elements (input fields, select boxes, buttons) with Tailwind CSS.
    - Adjusted text sizes and colors for better readability and hierarchy.
    - Increased top padding to prevent overlapping with the fixed Navbar.
- **Design Improvements (RecipeList.js):**
    - Refined recipe card styling with subtle shadows, borders, and pronounced lift on hover.
    - Improved search and filter section with better visual grouping and consistent input styling.
    - Increased top padding of the main content area to prevent overlapping with the fixed Navbar.
    - Applied fixed height to recipe cards and truncated long titles to prevent inconsistent card heights.
- **Removed Unused Files:** Deleted `client/src/logo.svg`, `client/src/setupTests.js`, and `client/src/App.test.js` to clean up the project.
- **New Feature: Meal Planning:**
    - Added `client/src/components/MealPlanner.js` component for meal planning functionality.
    - Created `client/src/components/MealPlanner.module.css` for styling the meal planner.
    - Integrated Meal Planner route (`/meal-planner`) into `client/src/App.js`.
    - Added a navigation link to the Meal Planner in `client/src/components/Navbar.js`.
    - **Bug Fix:** Fixed `SyntaxError: Unterminated string constant` in `client/src/components/MealPlanner.js` by converting a multi-line string to a template literal.
    - **UI Enhancement:** Increased top margin to the "Generate Shopping List" button in `client/src/components/MealPlanner.module.css` to `6rem` for better spacing.
    - **UI Enhancement:** Increased top margin to the `.mealPlannerContainer` in `client/src/components/MealPlanner.module.css` to `8rem` to clear the fixed navigation bar.
    - **Feature Refinement:** Replaced drag-and-drop functionality with a selection-based approach using a modal (`client/src/components/RecipeSelectionModal.js`) for improved usability.
    - **Feature Enhancement:** Enabled `RecipeSelectionModal` to search and fetch recipes from the Spoonacular API, combining them with local recipes for selection.
    - **Bug Fix:** Fixed `SyntaxError: Identifier 'searchTerm' has already been declared` in `client/src/components/RecipeSelectionModal.js` by removing the duplicate declaration.
    - **Shopping List Improvement:** Implemented fetching of full recipe details for API recipes when added to the meal plan, ensuring `extendedIngredients` are available for accurate shopping list generation.
    - **Shopping List Improvement:** Improved ingredient aggregation in `generateShoppingList` function in `client/src/components/MealPlanner.js` to group by name and unit.
    - **Bug Fix:** Fixed `showNotification` not defined error in `client/src/components/MealPlanner.js` by destructuring it from props.
- **Design Refinement:** Renamed CSS color variables in `client/src/styles/tokens.css` by removing the `--color-` prefix for consistency.
- **Design Refinement:** Applied `page-content-padding` class to `MealPlanner.js` and removed redundant `margin-top` from its CSS module for consistent global spacing.
- **Design Refinement:** Refined dark mode toggle button styling in `client/src/components/Navbar.js` to use CSS variables for consistency.
- **Design Refinement:** Improved form element styling in `client/src/components/RecipeForm.js` by applying consistent Tailwind classes, leveraging CSS variables, and enhancing focus states.
- **Design Refinement:** Increased font sizes in `client/src/styles/tokens.css` for improved readability across the application.
- **Design Refinement Limitation:** Unable to directly modify `client/src/index.css` for global dark mode color refinement or form element styling due to tool limitations in reading/writing the file.

### `new_client` (Vue.js Application)
- **Removal:** The `new_client` directory (Vue.js application) has been removed from the project as it was an alternative client no longer needed.

## Current Status & Next Steps:

- **Server Status:** The backend server is running and all tests are passing.
- **Client Status:** The React frontend is running and significantly improved in terms of design and layout.
- **API Connectivity:** The API is connecting successfully.
- **Outstanding Issues:**
    - **API Enhancements:** Discuss and implement enhancements to the existing API endpoints.
    - **Frontend Functionality:** Thoroughly test all features in the React frontend to ensure they work as expected with the updated backend logic.
    - **WebSocket Errors:** Persistent `WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3000/ws' failed` errors are still appearing in the browser console. These typically relate to the frontend development server's hot-reloading and need further investigation.
    - **Documentation Update:** Updated `README.md` with extensive, A-Z details about the project, consolidating information from `context.txt` and other sources.

## Next Action:
- Project paused. Will resume development later, focusing on completing backend tests and then moving to API enhancements and frontend functionality.
